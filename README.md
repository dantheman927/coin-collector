# coin-collector
very simple game made in c++ useing raylip libarly 
==================================================
if u want to look throught the code open it in the ide if ur choseig 
but if u want to play the game in the terminal (liunx) tbh idk how or if u can do it 
in mac or windows but in terminal u do ./game and it will run 

ps the code isnt complet is very messy and has some things that i havnt even used it works but its alr code it could be better
